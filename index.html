   <h3><em>What is an NFT? How do they work?</em></h3>
   <pr>1.NFT stands for NON-Fungible Token<br>
       2.NON Fungible Means Items that are irreplaceable.<br>
       3.We can replace money, commodity, cryptocurrencies, etc. because all things are fungible items.<br>
       4.The art of Monalisa is NON-Fungible because it isnâ€™t replaceable by anything else in this world.</pr><hr>

       <h3><em>How Do NFTs work?</em></h3>
       <pr>Smart contracts that assign ownership and govern the transferability of NFTs are used to create them. When someone generates or mints an NFT, they are executing code from smart contracts that follow various standards, such as ERC-721. This data is added to the blockchain, which is where the NFT is controlled.
     The bulk of NFTs are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that keeps track of transactions.
     NFTs are individual tokens that contain vital information.
     They can be purchased and sold like other physical pieces of art because their worth is mostly determined by market and demand.
     The unique data on NFTs makes it simple to verify and validate their ownership as well as token transfers between owners.
     This may sound too technical so in simple words,
     NFTs are blockchain-based cryptographic tokens that are one-of-a-kind and cannot be duplicated. NFTs can be used to represent real-world objects such as art and real estate. These real-world tangible goods can be "tokenizing"(into digital form as NFT) to make purchasing, selling, and trading more efficient while also lowering the risk of fraud.</pr><hr>

     <h3><strong>Cryptocurrencies Which is use in Nfts</strong></h3>
     <p>Like cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens also exist on a blockchain. It confirms the ownership and unique identity of the digital asset. A technology similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum is used to build NFTs. In fact, Ethereum is the widely accepted crypto in the NFT market
